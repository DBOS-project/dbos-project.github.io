This project is building a completely new operating system (OS) stack. Rather than build on a single node OS together with separate cluster schedulers, distributed filesystems, and network managers, we argue that a distributed transactional DBMS should be the basis for a scalable cluster OS.
We have shown that such a database OS (DBOS) can do scheduling, file management, and inter-process communication with competitive performance to existing systems. 
In addition, significantly better analytics can be provided as well as a dramatic reduction in code complexity through implementing OS services as standard database queries, while implementing low-latency transactions and high availability only once.
Our future plan is to build a complete end-to-end prototype of DBOS.

The DBOS project is a collaboration between MIT, Stanford, CMU, MIT Lincoln Lab, VMware, and Google.
